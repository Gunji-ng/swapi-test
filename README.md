# swapi-test
To run this testsuite, clone it to your local system,
'cd' to the project's directory on your terminal then run 'npm install' to get the needed packages.
Run the 'npm test' or 'npm run test' command to see the execution and results.

N.B: if you run into any issues with permissions for mocha, simply uninstall it using 'npm uninstall --save-dev mocha',
then reinstall it using 'npm install --save-dev mocha'. 'npm test' should run properly now.
